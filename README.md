### Why the Code Wasn't Working Before:
In the original code, items was a public property of the object returned by createStack. This means that anyone could directly access and modify the items array from outside the stack object. This exposed the internal implementation of the stack, allowing external code to manipulate the stack's internal state in unintended ways.

### Why the Refactored Code Works Now:
In the refactored code, items is a private variable within the scope of the createStack function. This variable is enclosed by the push and pop methods, forming a closure. Since the items array is not part of the returned object, it is not accessible from outside, preserving the encapsulation of the stack's internal state.
